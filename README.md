# Geometry Dash icon swapper
## ¿What?
This is a simple python script to replace Geometry Dash icon textures

## ¿Why?
I saw on twitter people saying that "icon hack is not purely cosmetic because it causes server-side changes", so i decided to make an actually purely cosmetic alternative, that just edits the textures.

## How to install and use:
###### WARNINGS:
###### This will do (probably major?) changes to your game's files, so if any update comes you may need to re-run this program.
###### If you ever want to go back to the vanilla textures, you can either backup your icons folder before running this program, or use the backup it automatically makes.
###### This is (for now) only supported for Windows, as i don't have a MacOS System to test this on.

#### 1. Downloading
For this, you can either clone the repository, or download the release, both will get you the executables (PLEASE PUT THE ``pack.json`` IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE EXECUTABLE)

#### 2. Running
Copy your icons folder (located on ``Geometry Dash/Resources``) to the same directory as the script, then run it, it will give instructions.\
For finding the IDs you may want to use [GDColon's online Icon Kit](https://gdbrowser.com/iconkit/)

## Troubleshooting
### The .exe doesn't open!
Make sure to have the icons folder on the same directory (as mentioned above)

### Literally any other thing:
idk anymore man, i probably just fucked something up\
Make an issue and i'll probably fix it

## Contributing
Make a PR and if it's good i'll probably merge it
